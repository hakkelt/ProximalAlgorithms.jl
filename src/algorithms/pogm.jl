    POGMIteration(; <keyword-arguments>)

Iterator implementing the proximal optimized gradient method (POGM) [1].

This iterator solves convex optimization problems of the form

    minimize f(x) + g(x),

where `f` is smooth. Currently only supports the `mf == 0`, fixed-stepsize case.

Unlike a proximal-gradient method, POGM's worst-case rate is *tight*: the
momentum it carries is the largest a first-order method can carry, so a
stepsize even slightly above `1/Lf` can make it diverge rather than merely
converge more slowly. Since an `Lf` obtained from a power iteration is an
under-estimate (the power method converges from below), `adaptive_restart`
is on by default. It resets the extrapolation parameter to 1 on either of the
two conditions of [1]: when `f + g` has risen from the previous iterate, and
when the generalized gradient at the new iterate points along the direction
just travelled — the momentum is fighting descent. Both are needed: with a
`Zero` `g` the prox is the identity, so the generalized gradient is identically
zero and only the function test can fire. Together they accelerate the typical
case and keep a slightly optimistic `Lf` from diverging.

See also: [`POGM`](@ref).

# Arguments
- `x0`: initial point.
- `f=Zero()`: smooth objective term.
- `g=Zero()`: proximable objective term.
- `Lf=nothing`: Lipschitz constant of the gradient of `f`.
- `gamma=nothing`: stepsize to use, defaults to `1/Lf` if not set (but `Lf` is).
- `adaptive_restart=true`: reset the extrapolation whenever the objective rises or the momentum stops pointing downhill, and back `gamma` off when it rises on consecutive iterations.
- `adaptive=(gamma === nothing)`: backtrack the stepsize against a descent condition every iteration, at the cost of one extra evaluation of `f`. On by default exactly when no stepsize was supplied, since the fallback `gamma` is then derived from a *lower* bound on the smoothness constant and is unsafe for POGM.
- `reduce_gamma=0.5`: factor the stepsize is multiplied by when that backoff fires.
- `minimum_gamma=1e-7`: floor for the stepsize backoff.

    POGM(; <keyword-arguments>)

Constructs the proximal optimized gradient method (POGM) [1].

This algorithm solves convex optimization problems of the form

    minimize f(x) + g(x),

where `f` is smooth. It has a worst-case rate a factor of 2 better than
FISTA's; see [`FastForwardBackward`](@ref) for the FISTA-type accelerated
forward-backward splitting algorithm, of which this is a momentum-update
variant. The gradient-based adaptive restart of [1] is on by default; see
[`POGMIteration`](@ref) for why.

The returned object has type `IterativeAlgorithm{POGMIteration}`,
and can be called with the problem's arguments to trigger its solution.

See also: [`POGMIteration`](@ref), [`FastForwardBackward`](@ref), [`IterativeAlgorithm`](@ref).

# Arguments
- `maxit::Int=10_000`: maximum number of iteration
- `tol::1e-8`: tolerance for the default stopping criterion
- `stop::Function`: termination condition, `stop(::T, state)` should return `true` when to stop the iteration
- `solution::Function`: solution mapping, `solution(::T, state)` should return the identified solution
- `verbose::Bool=false`: whether the algorithm state should be displayed
- `freq::Int=100`: every how many iterations to display the algorithm state
- `display::Function`: display function, `display(::Int, ::T, state)` should display a summary of the iteration state
- `kwargs...`: additional keyword arguments to pass on to the `POGMIteration` constructor upon call
